## Hi there 👋

I'm currently a student with a passion for cybersecurity. Always curious and eager to learn, I'm exploring the different facets of this field both through my studies and through self-taught learning.
On my GitHub, I regularly share my projects and learning progress. These include practical exercises, scripts, tools I've developed and research I've carried out to deepen my skills. My aim is to document my progress and exchange with other enthusiasts and professionals in the field.
I firmly believe in the importance of sharing knowledge, and this approach allows me not only to progress, but also to contribute, in my own way, to the cybersecurity community.
